# Systemd system extension (sysext) tutorial

For the slides and context, see:
[Contribfest: Extending Image Based Systems Using Systemd System Extensions](https://kccnceu2025.sched.com/event/1tcxe/contribfest-extending-image-based-systems-using-systemd-system-extensions)

By default, the first hands on features Fedora CoreOS, the second Flatcar
Container Linux and the third both. All hands on are available for both Flatcar
Container Linux and Fedora CoreOS so you can pick either operating system.

* [Hands-on 1: Use a sysext (wasmtime) on Fedora CoreOS](./hands-on-1)
* [Hands-on 2: Build a sysext for CRI-O for Flatcar Container Linux](./hands-on-2)
* [Hands-on 3: Setup a small Kubernetes Cluster with Flatcar and Fedora CoreOS nodes, using sysexts](./hands-on-3)

If you are new to Flatcar Container Linux and Fedora CoreOS, see our talk at KubeCon/CloudNativeCon Europe (Paris) 2024:
